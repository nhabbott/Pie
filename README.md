# Pie

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/78d14797ee4b46f7bdfb04effea54cfa)](https://app.codacy.com/app/nhabbott/Pie?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=nhabbott/Pie&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

A very rudimentary scripting language written in Golang.

## Math
Math in pie follows no normal guide lines... To add numbers, you must surround them with parenthesis like `(55)`. For example, `print (55)` would result in `10`.

## Compilation Commands
Normal: `go run pie.go -f=path/to/file.pie`
Verbose: `go run pie.go -f=path/to/file.pie -v`

### In Progress
