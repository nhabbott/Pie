# Pie
A very rudimentary scripting language written in Golang.

## Note
At the moment the only functions pie posses is 'print', and only strings can be printed. Expressions are printed as text instead of being
evaluated because I can't figure out how to implement this.

## Compilation Commands
Normal: `go run pie.go -f=path/to/file.pie`
Verbose: `go run pie.go -f=path/to/file.pie -v`

### In Progress
- Lexer
- Parser
- Expressions

### To be Implemented
- Features
  1. Functions
  2. Variables
